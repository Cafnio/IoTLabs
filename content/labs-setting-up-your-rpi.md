#Lab - Setting up your Raspberry Pi 3

If you haven't already done so, please follow the instructions in the ['Getting Started'](../getting-started/) section.

In this prep guide, you will install Windows 10 IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi 3. 

### Install Windows 10 IoT Core on Raspberry Pi 3
Windows 10 IoT Core is a version of Windows 10 designed to run on small devices, like the Raspberry Pi 3. You can download and install the Windows IoT Core image onto the micro SD card. 

1. In a browser, navigate to the [Microsoft Windows IoT Downloads &amp; Tools page](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/Downloads.htm). 
2. Click on the **Get IoT Core Dashboard** button to download the dashboard utility.
3. Once the **setup.exe** has downloaded, open it to install the dashboard utility.

Once the Windows IoT Core Dashboard is installed, use it to flash the microSD card with the latest Windows IoT Core OS image.

1. Insert the micro SD card into your SD card writer.
2. In the IoT Dashboard, select *Set up a new device*.

3. Use the dropdown list to make *Device Type* = **Raspberry Pi 2 & 3**.
4. Select **Windows 10 IoT Core**.
4. Select the microSD card in the *Drive* dropdown list.
5. If you're using a wireless connection, make sure your development computer is alread in the wireless network. If so you shoud have it listed in the Wi-Fi Network connections. Select the one you want.*
6. Check the box for *I accept the software license terms* (of course you have already read them).
7. Click the **Download and install** button.

> *If no wi-fi connection shows up, don't worry: we'll configure the wi-fi with a wired connection, afterwards.

7. When prompted, select **Continue** indicating that you have backed up any files from the microSD card before it gets erased.

The download and install could take some time depending on your bandwidth and the size of the microSD card. When it is complete you will see the *You SD card is ready* screen.

### Connect the Raspberry Pi 3
You are now ready to connect and power on your Raspberry Pi 3.

1. Insert the micro SD card with the Windows 10 IoT Core image on it into your Raspberry Pi 3. (The slot is on the underside, on the opposite edge from the side with the USB ports.)
2. Connect a network cable from your local network to the Ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi 3. 
3. Instead, if you are provided with a wireless network, it should be configured, already
3. Your development device must be on the same network.
4. Connect an HDMI monitor to the HDMI port on the board.
5. Connect the power supply to the micro USB port on the board. You must power this from the 5V 2A adapter - USB power from your computer is insufficient.

Windows 10 IoT Core will boot on power-up. The first boot may take a few minutes.

### Set the Machine Name and Password
Once the Raspberry Pi 3 has booted up, it will appear in the *My devices* tab of the IoT Dashboard - by default it will have the name **Administrator** and an Administrator password of **q1w2e3.**. It is recommend that you change both of these to avoid confusion with other devices on your network.

1. Click on the stylus icon to edit the Raspberry Pi 3.
2. Change the password if you would like.
3. Change the name to something unique (remember, you are naming a Windows device - all normal naming rules and practices apply). <code>Tip: use your team name!</code>
4. Click **Accept** to accept the changes and reboot the RPi3

Your Raspberry Pi 3 will reboot and when it is back up and running it will have the new name you gave it, and the Administrator account will use the password you created. 

### Conclusion &amp; Next Steps
In this section you prepared your Raspberry Pi 3 for the subsequent labs. Next you will do the IoT equivalent of a 'Hello, World!' program: you will make an LED blink.
